You can add a device to your list by opening the tab for the device type.  For
instance, if you want to add a new email account, open the "add a new Email 
device" tab.  The section will list all the required settings or that device,
and the rules to assign to each priority.  For more information on priorities,
please refer to the <a href="priorities.jsp">help section on priorities</a>.
