<p>
The "tab" (the rectangular grey region at the top of the "pending notifications" 
section) contains some useful controls.  The four colored buttons show how many 
active (ie, not expired or confirmed), confirmed or expired notifications are
in the list.  Clicking the colored box toggles display of these notifications 
on or off.  The final field allows you to increase or decrease the amount of time
that the system will search through to find the notifications to display

<p>Every notification has 3 sections; a quick summary, a list of messages, 
and a list of people that the messages were sent to.  </p>
<p>
The summary includes the subject of the notification, the person who sent it, 
the time it was sent, and the notification ID.  The notification ID is useful 
for confirming notifications via the dial-in automated system.</p>

<p>
The recipient list contains all the people who this notification was sent to.  
If it was sent to an escalation group, you will see all the members of the group 
in the list.  The person whom the notification is currently waiting for will 
be noted with asterix around their name.
