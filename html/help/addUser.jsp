<h2>The User's Information</h2>
<p>
You may enter the new user's first name, last name, department, and a 
new password.  This information does not affect how the user receives 
notifications, but changes the display of the user's information on the 
website and in the logs and reports.  Once you have changed this 
information, click "save" to save it.
</p>
<h2>The User's Work Hours</h2>
<p>
When editing the user's groups and devices, you may configure how the system uses
devices.  One of your options to is tell the system to not use a device when
the user is out of the office.  The "Work Hours" settings allow you to define 
what the user's work hours are, so the system knows when to contact the user.  You 
may look at the <a href="priorities.jsp">priorities section</a> for more information
on how work hours affects how notifications are received.
