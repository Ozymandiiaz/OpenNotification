<h1>Sending a New Notification</h1>

<p>
This section explains the purpose of the section titled "Send A New Notification"</p>
<p>
There are three sections within this tab, one for creating the message and two for 
choosing the recipients.
</p>
<h2>Creating the Message</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Creating a message is much like sending an email.  There is a subject field, a message 
field, and a list of recipients.  The subject field should contain a quick summary of
the message, but, since some devices don't support subject fields (like pagers), the 
subject should not contain information vital to understanding the notification.
<p>
<p>
The message field contains all the important information that must reach your recipients.
Since some devices only support a small amount of text (as little as 128 characters for
some cell phone's text messaging), you should keep the message short and sweet.  Reliable
Response Notification&#8482; will handle long messages properly, so you don't have to
worry about the message failing if it is too long, so feel free to add additional 
information even if it exceeds the size limits of the recipients' devices.
</p>
<p>
The recipients box is filled in below.  If you have added a recipient by mistake, you can
delete that use by highlighting his or her name and clicking the "delete" button".
</p>
<h2>Searching For Recipients</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The section titles "search for new recipient(s)" allows you to search the user list for
recipients.  Reliable Response Notification&#8482; will search through the users and groups
for any name that matches the text you enter.  You may limit the search by selecting a type
of recipient; a group or an individual.  When you have the fields filled in, click the 
"search" button to perform the search.
</p>
<p>

<p>
After the search has completed, the matching users will be shown in a list below the search
form.  You may select any user by checking the box to the left of their name and then 
clicking "add selected".  You may also open the user's tab to find a short description of 
the user and a list of devices the user supports.  You may select any of the devices, instead
of selecting the user, to send to those devices only. When you have selected all the users
or users' devices, click "add selected" to add them to the recipients list.
</p>
<h2>Selecting Recipients From A List</h2>
<p>

<p>
Another way of finding users is to selected them from the list below the search area.  This
area lists all the users that have devices available and groups that have members.  Simply 
highlight the names of the users to add and click "add selected".
